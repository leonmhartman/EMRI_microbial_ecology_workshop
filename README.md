# EMRI_workshop
This repo contains files I used for the half-day workshop I presented in Nov 2019 to postgraduate researchers associated with the Environmental Microbiology Research Initiative (Melbourne, Australia).

It contains:
+ a file of the presentation slides describing a basic R-based analysis of meta-barcoding (16S) data
+ the R scripts used in the analysis
+ bonus material â€“ an example of a QIIME2 Bash script (and associated metadata files) used to process raw 16S sequence data
