# EMRI_workshop
This repo contains the files I used for a half-day workshop for postgraduate researchers associated with the Environmental Microbiology Research Initiative (Melbourne, Australia).

It contains:
+ a file of the presentation slides describing a basic R-based workflow for analysing meta-barcoding data
+ the R scripts used in the workflow
+ a QIIME2 script (with associated metadata files) that I would have used if I had processed the raw sequence data
