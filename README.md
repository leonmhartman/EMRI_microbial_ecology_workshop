# EMRI_workshop
This repo contains the files I used for a half-day workshop that I presented to postgraduate researchers associated with the Environmental Microbiology Research Initiative (Melbourne, Australia).

It contains:
+ a file of the presentation slides describing a basic R-based analysis of meta-barcoding data
+ the R scripts used in the analysis
+ the QIIME2 Bash script (and associated metadata files) that I used to process the raw sequence data
